     * Base - the base class which handles all the SmartPimpl magic.
     * When a class derives from Base, it must give the class the policy
     * which it is to use for the pointer (reference and entity semantics are
     * already provided @see Entity and @see Reference).
     *
     * In all translation units that include the interface of a class, they will
     * therefore see that the class has an implementation but they will not be able
     * to use it because it will be an incomplete type. In the implementation of the interface
     * therefore the user must define the implementation before any function attempts to use it
     * as to complete the type. In doing so we now have a perfect split between interface and implementation,
     * and can provide interface and implementation inheritance separately (Ã  la GoF Bridge Pattern).
     *
     * This also provides the benefit of less recompilation when the implementation is a part of the header
     * file and it changes - all affected files don't need to be recompiled, which keeps a stable ABI.
     *
     * To use this class a CRTP-like derivation must be made. When declaring class Foo, this must be written:
     * class Foo : SmartPimpl::[Reference | Entity | <other>]<Foo> { ... };
     * This will generate a completely new type with its own implementation declared (SmartPimpl::<Base><Foo>>::Impl)
     * that must be filled in in the implementation. Naturally, the implementation cannot be abstract.
     * Additionally, the 5 special member functions can remain compiler generated for the interface unless explicitly
     * needed, and an error will occur if the Policy doesn't allow for an operation (e.g. copying an Entity).
     *
     * @tparam Interface - the class using SmartPimpl
     * @tparam Policy - storage policy used. Affects copyablity and movability.
